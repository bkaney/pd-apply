Obese individuals can lose weight by following reducing diets that vary widely
in macronutrient composition. Caloric restriction, however, rather than
macronutrient composition, is the key determinant of weight loss. A successful
reducing diet is one that an individual can adhere to for several months to
lose 5% to 10% of initial weight

training. Detailed descriptions of this approach have been provided.
